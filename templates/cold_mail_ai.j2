Subject: Seeking {{ job.title or "Software Engineer" }} Opportunity at {{ recruiter.company }} | 1.5+ Year Experience in Backend & AI Systems

{{ greeting }}

I hope this email finds you well. My name is {{ sender.name }}, and I'm a Software Engineer with over one and a half year of experience building scalable backend systems and AI-powered platforms. I'm reaching out because I'm very interested in exploring Software Engineer opportunities at {{ recruiter.company }}.

Currently at SquadStack, I've been working on high-impact projects that align well with {{ recruiter.company }}'s focus on cloud infrastructure and AI:

- Scaled an AI voice bot platform handling 100K+ automated calls daily, achieving 95%+ resource utilization through optimized concurrency management
- Architected a PII Vault service with AWS-integrated encryption and automated secret rotation, ensuring zero-downtime security compliance
- Executed zero-downtime database partitioning for tables processing 1M+ writes per day, improving query performance by 60%

My technical stack includes Python, Java, AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, KMS), PostgreSQL, Redis, and Django/FastAPI, with hands-on experience in building secure, scalable cloud-native applications.

I believe my experience in building production-grade systems at scale would enable me to contribute meaningfully to your teams.

I've attached my resume for your review. Would you be open to considering my application for relevant Software Engineer roles, or could you point me toward the best way to apply? I'd be grateful for any guidance you can provide.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of connecting.
